    <h2>Article 1</h2>
    
    <p>The Joker is a fictional supervillain from American comic book publisher DC Comics and the main antagonist in Christopher
        Nolan's 2008 superhero film The Dark Knight. He was portrayed by late Australian actor Heath Ledger. Ledger's interpretation
        of the character is specifically influenced by the graphic novels Batman: The Killing Joke and Arkham Asylum: A Serious
        House on Serious Earth. In the film, he wears the character's traditional color palette, while his facial appearance
        includes clown makeup that covers facial scars of a Glasgow smile.</p>

    <h3>Article 2</h3>
    <p2>The Joker is considered Ledger's finest performance; he himself regarded it as his most enjoyable. When the film was
        released in July 2008, six months after the actor had died from an accidental prescription drug overdose, the performance
        caused a sensation and received universal acclaim and numerous posthumous accolades, including the Academy Award
        for Best Supporting Actor.</p2>
